Rewrite photometry script, use "Comp XX" instead of "compXX" and include filenames, make hjd keys floats rather than strings
Interactive plotting lib?
Find where we got asassn.csv (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d9Juse6ypeOUuyw3v1LNPXvEkpuZrROUY4Xb9DPQFJY/edit)
Finish the QR doc/page (use GH Pages)
Short screencast: decrease speed of Sabine and JB's sections
Slides: title/caption can be above or below figures, but do it consistently
Idea: script to download data files from e.g. google drive?
Remove popup (title) from dag.svg. Idea: create a new element with the title as a value, so the graph.js code still works.
lib/graph.js: make all non-directly related nodes/edges lighter when a node is clicked (or maybe do this instead of highlighting connected edges?)
Maybe try rewriting some scripts in julia w/ https://cjdoris.github.io/PythonCall.jl/stable/ + PyYAML instead of YAMl.jl
Install ipynb and add JB's code
Do something about large files (for screencasts); e.g. Git LFS
License
Codespaces Prebuild conf (see GH repo settings)
Set up GH pages (for QR doc)
Track poster/slides in build system (after porting to LaTeX)
In the color plot there are no points at phase = 0.3 or 0.7. Why?
Upload data to webobs
Noteworthy: big red star in midde(ish) of cluster is too red to be in isochrone (?)
Check that timestamps work between Overleaf and Git/Github
Do fancy linking stuff w/ citations and figures in Gdocs
The light curves seem a lot less clean than the old ones. Why?
Why does query.py get rebuild so often?
Experiment with larger font sizes
