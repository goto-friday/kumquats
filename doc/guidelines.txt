- Manually created files (i.e. those not generated via a script *in this
  repo*) should be documented in an INDEX file in that file's directory,
  except in very obvious cases. See dat/INDEX directory for example.
- Nothing should be hard coded the scripts, and hardcoding data should be
  avoided as much as possible altogether. Anything that does need to be
  hardcoded should be in dat/custom.yaml.
- Target whatever versions of software Colab has. As of 2023-05-14, that
  is Ubuntu 20.04.5 and Python 3.10.11.
