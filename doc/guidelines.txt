- Files whose purpose is not obvious from the filename should be documented
  in an INDEX.txt file in the respective directory. See doc/INDEX.txt for
  example.
- Don't hard-code any data into the code; all hard-coded data should go in
  dat/config.yml.
- Don't store PDFs of the LaTeX files in the repo; likewise, don't make the
  build system track LaTeX files.
- Give text files (such as this one) the '.txt' extension; otherwise
  Overleaf will be finicky about viewing/editing them.
- On breaking changes in code (e.g. reformatting a data structure): Tommy's
  opinion is thus: The ultimate goal is usable code. Usability in this
  context means that it runs, but also that it can be understood a few
  months later. Do whatever best promotes that goal; if that means making a
  breaking change to considerably simplify some code, do it. Just make sure
  that everything builds before committing.
