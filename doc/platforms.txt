Except where otherwise noted, this document is written from the perspective
of Tommy M.

For platforms designated as "supported," the code is very likely to run,
and if it does not, I will fix it. For other platforms, I cannot guarantee
that I will be able to help.


Linux/Glibc x86_64
==================

Supported.

This includes (among others) Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora; most notably, it
does not include Alpine Linux. Relatively old versions (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04)
should work, since we don't rely on the operating system's package manager.

All web-based development platforms of which I am aware (Google Colab,
Replit, Github Codespaces, etc.) use some version of Ubuntu, and thus
should work.

Non-x86_64 platforms will probably work, assuming the requisite packages
run on them. Brew only supports x86_64, so one would need to modify the
`pkgs` function of lib/setup.sh.

Musl might or might not work; I've encountered many scientific computing
packages that are broken on it, so I would not hold much hope of getting
this to work on Musl. A different package manager would probably also be
necessary.


MacOS x86_64
============

Only version 11 (Big Sur) is supported, because that's what I own.

Currently the build script for macOS is unfinished. I'll do it when I
get a chance, unless someone else does first. The Linux build script
does work (though is as of now untested on Colab).

TODO explain dtrace/root situation


Windows
=======

Unsupported.

I don't own a copy of Windows, and have never used it, so I don't have the
knowledge to write portable code for it. I would recommend using WSL, a VM,
or a web-based runtime instead.


Other
=====

The situation on BSD is mostly the same as Linux/Musl; many scientific
computing packages will cause problems. FreeBSD is probably the most likely
to work given its Linux emulation facilities.
